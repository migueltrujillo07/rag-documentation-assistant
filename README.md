# RAG Documentation Assitant 
This project implements a Retrival-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering question with technical documentation.

The goal is desing an end-to-end, evaluation-diven RAG pipeline that retrives revelant document chunks and generates grounded answers with citations.

This repository is part of a professional Machine Learning / IA Engineering portfolio.
